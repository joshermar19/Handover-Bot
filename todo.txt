Upcoming/Possible ideas:

-Use Vault API for secrets
-In addition to P1/P2, include issues containing a certain label `noc-handover`
-Exclusively include issues containing a certain label
-Send periodic or triggered updates to slack channel when handover ticket is modified, such as when important notes are added for on-coming NOC techs
